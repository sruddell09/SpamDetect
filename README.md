# SpamDetect
This is a python program that emulates a spam detector using a Naive Bayes classifier.

Pipe the training file ("spam_assassin.train") using cat into spamDetect.py. 
The program outputs the precision and recall of the spam dectector based on the test file ("spam_assassin.train"). 

This project was originally created for my Introduction to Natural Language Processing course at San Jose State University.
